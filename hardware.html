  <p>Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly.

Don’t fucking lie to yourself. You are not your fucking work.

Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Form follows fucking function. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother?

Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. This design is fucking brilliant. Form follows fucking function. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere.

To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work.

Intuition is fucking important.

Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic.

When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning.

To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work.

You are not your fucking work. Must-do is a good fucking master. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing.

The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Form follows fucking function. Form follows fucking function. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. This design is fucking brilliant.

Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure.
