              <h2>Purpose</h2>
              <p>The purpose of this class is to advance our computer literacy. As the wonderful Mr Hesby once put it "Computer Literacy is no longer for a specific group of people but part of our everyday life.  Computers are used in many ways to make our lives better and the more we understand how they work and what theyâ€™re capable of, the more they can be utilized by everyone." In this class we will all advance toward those high-minded and lofty goals.<p>
